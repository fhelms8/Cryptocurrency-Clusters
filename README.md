# Cryptocurrency-Clusters
Unsupervised Machine Learning

I have been hired to help an investment bank create a portfolio for its customers who are interesting in investing in cryptocurrency. The company has asked me to create a report to determine whether crypto's can be grouped to create a classification system for their new investment. 

I was given raw data and needed to preform data clean ups and data processing before plotting and attempting to make any type of clusters. 

Please click on "Instructions" then proceed to the jupyter notebook file within.
